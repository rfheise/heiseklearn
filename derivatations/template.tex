\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

Describe the model's use cases and what it is best at. 

\section{Background}

Any math background required goes here. For example for GLM's explain exponential families.
Terms should also be defined here. 

\section{How it works}

Give a high level overview of how it works and also briefly describe runtime




\section{Model Space}

Describe the model space and what the model looks like

\section{Score Function}

Describe how the model is scored


\section{Search Method}

Describe how the model space is searched for the ideal model


\section{Explain It Like I'm 5}

GLM's draw a line to better understand the data. The line is drawn based upon assumptions between the desired result and the data itself.
